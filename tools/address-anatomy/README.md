- fixed-length addresses (20 bytes / 40 hex chars)
- `0x` prefix
- checksum casing (EIP-55)
- relationship to public keys (conceptual)

## Used in labs

---

## Network requirements
None.  
This tool performs **no blockchain calls**.

## Notes for educators
- This tool is exploratory, not evaluative
- Encourage students to paste **their own wallet address**
- Use it as a discussion starter about identity and irreversibility
